# Lab 09: LINQ in Manhattan

## Problem Domain

This program is designed to read data from an external JSON file containing location information for properties in Manhattan. The program will use LINQ queries and Lambda statements to filter and process the data based on specified conditions.

## Specifications

### Input

The `data.json` file containing location information for properties in Manhattan.

### Output

The program will output answers to the following questions:

1. Output all of the neighborhoods in this data list. (Final Total: 147 neighborhoods)
2. Filter out all the neighborhoods that do not have any names. (Final Total: 143 neighborhoods)
3. Remove duplicates from the neighborhoods. (Final Total: 39 neighborhoods)
4. Rewrite the queries from above and consolidate all into one single query.
5. Rewrite at least one of these questions using the opposing method (e.g., using LINQ Query statements instead of LINQ method calls, and vice versa).

## How to Use

1. Clone or download the project from the repository.
3. Place the `data.json` file into the root folder of the solution.
4. Run the program, and it will output the answers to the questions on the console.
